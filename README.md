Customer Credit Rating using Social Media Analytics
Here the analysis is done using various machine Learning models e.g. LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, SVC, RandomForestClassifier, 
GradientBoostingClassifier .
Hyperparameter optimization was done for all the models to obtain the best working model.
GradientBoostingClassifier is found to be providing highest accuracy on test data. 
Hence this model is selected for prediction.
